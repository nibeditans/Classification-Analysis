# Classification-Analysis
This repository contains code for performing classification analysis on the "Classification Analysis" dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset used in this analysis is the "iris.csv" file.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the "iris.csv" file. It contains information about various attributes of iris flowers, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and species. The goal of this analysis is to predict the species of an iris flower based on its attributes.

## Code
The code provided performs the following steps:

1. Importing the required libraries, including pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
2. Loading the dataset using the read_csv() function from pandas.
3. Displaying the first few rows of the dataset using the head() function.
4. Checking for missing values in the dataset using the isnull().sum() function and creating a table summarizing the missing values.
5. Encoding the categorical variable "Species" using the LabelEncoder() function from scikit-learn.
6. Splitting the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from scikit-learn.
7. Building and training a decision tree model using the DecisionTreeClassifier() class from scikit-learn.
8. Making predictions on the testing set using the trained model.
9. Evaluating the performance of the model using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix metrics from scikit-learn.
    
Please note that you may need to install the required libraries mentioned in the code before running it.

## Usage
To use this code, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
2. Download the "iris.csv" dataset from the Kaggle website and place it in the same directory as the code file.
3. Open the code file and run it using a Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook.
4. The code will load the dataset, perform classification analysis using a decision tree model, and display the evaluation metrics.

Feel free to modify the code according to your specific requirements or explore different machine learning algorithms for classification.

## Results
The code calculates and outputs the following metrics:

* Accuracy: The accuracy score of the trained decision tree model on the testing set.
* Classification Report: A detailed report showing precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class in the testing set.
* Confusion Matrix: A table showing the counts of true positive, false negative, false positive, and true negative predictions for each class in the testing set.
You can use these metrics to assess the performance of the classification model and make further interpretations based on your specific use case.
